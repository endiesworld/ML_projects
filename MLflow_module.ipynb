Using the mlflow-dot-sklearn module users can do the following: Use the save_model function to save a model to the local filesystem. The log_model function logs the model to MLflow Tracking as an artifact within a run. Finally, the load_model function is used to load the model from either the local filesystem or from MLflow Tracking.\n",

    "## Load model\n",
    "When loading an MLflow Model it is important to understand what location formats are supported. When loading a model from the local filesystem, load_model supports both relative and absolute paths. To load a model from MLflow Tracking, MLflow uses a \"runs\" format where the run id and model path must be included. MLflow also supports loading models from AWS S3 and other cloud storages."
