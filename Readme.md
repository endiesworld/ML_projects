# Supervised Learning

**Endogenous Variable:** An endogenous variable, also called a dependent variable, is a variable whose value is determined by the model.
**Exogenous Variable:** An exogenous variable, also called an independent variable, is a variable whose value is determined outside of the model or is given to us.

## Relashionships between Endogenous Variable and Exogenous Variables

After defining endogenous variables and exogenous variables for our regression model, we will use some graphical tools to investigate the relationships of our selected variables. This step is important because these graphs can give us information as to how to structure our regression model and decide if some selected variables and data points should be excluded.

**Scatter plot:** A scatter plot is a two-dimensional graph with one variable on one axis and another variable on another axis. A scatter plot can show us the relationship of two variables.
